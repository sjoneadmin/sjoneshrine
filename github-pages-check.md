# GitHub Pages Deployment Status

## Current Issue
- Site at https://sjoneadmin.github.io/sjoneshrine/ is showing static HTML instead of React app
- React app is built and files are ready, but not being served

## Files Ready for Deployment
✅ index.html (React app entry point)
✅ static/ folder (CSS/JS assets)  
✅ asset-manifest.json
✅ .nojekyll file
✅ qr-code.png

## Likely Solutions

### Option 1: GitHub Pages Configuration  
**Problem**: GitHub Pages might be configured wrong
**Solution**: 
1. Go to https://github.com/sjoneadmin/sjoneshrine/settings/pages
2. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Set Branch to "main" 
4. Set Folder to "/ (root)"
5. Save

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
**Problem**: Browser caching old version
**Solution**: 
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)  
- Clear cache for the site
- Try incognito/private browser

### Option 3: GitHub Pages Build Delay
**Problem**: Takes 5-10 minutes to deploy
**Solution**: Wait and check again
