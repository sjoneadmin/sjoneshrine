The previous AI engineer's work primarily involved two major phases: initial feature implementation and extensive debugging of deployment issues on GitHub Pages. Initially, features for an application form (multi-character storyboard, 27 questions, dynamic fields) were successfully added, alongside a comprehensive homepage and donations tracker. However, the core challenge became persistent GitHub deployment failures, attributed to Git authentication and a hidden submodule. This led to a drastic decision to recommend the user manually create a *new repository* and upload static HTML files. Despite providing updated HTML content for all pages, the user repeatedly reported that changes were not visible. This cycle of updates and reported non-visibility, particularly for the donations tracker, consumed significant effort. The trajectory concludes with the critical revelation, assisted by a , that an underlying React application was still active and intercepting routes, causing the static HTML changes to be ignored. The AI then pivoted back to addressing the React codebase directly, attempting to modify its components.

The overarching goal is to establish a public-facing website for Sjòne Shrine, a non-profit supporting young women aged 18-25. This includes a comprehensive homepage, an interactive application form, and a donations tracker.
Key requirements:
- **Homepage ():** Must feature specific content for Hero, About (Who We Serve for adolescent women 18-25), Our Approach (clinical, cyber, self-hood disciplines), Programs (exclusive 4-applicant, once-every-four-years process), Were Here For You" support points, Community Support ("Youre Still Welcome with broader services and resources), a Disclaimer, and a Conclusion. Navigation logo should be a consistent leaf spiral design.
- **Application Form ():** Designed as an interactive storyboard with guiding characters (Cosimia, Novalie). It must include profile photo/bio, 27 detailed questions, conditional logic for fields, and progressive dialogue reveals (like a gaming experience).
- **Donations Tracker ():** Must replicate the exact original appearance and functionality, including a 00,000 goal, ,750 current amount, animated leaf logo (diamond pattern for the main one), progress bars for four phases, a list of recent donations, and a hidden admin panel (activated by Ctrl+Shift+A or 5 logo clicks) for manual donation entry and data management. Its navigation logo must match the leaf spiral.
The system needs to support static site hosting on GitHub Pages, with all pages accessible via a custom domain ().
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Initial frontend framework; its persistent presence caused deployment conflicts.
- ****: Used for client-side data persistence for the static donations tracker.
- **GitHub Pages**: Static site hosting platform.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control for project management and deployment, specifically  and submodule issues.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Primary technologies used for the static site recreations.
- **Conditional Rendering**: JavaScript logic for dynamic form fields and content reveals.

<code_architecture>
The application's architecture started as a React/FastAPI setup but pivoted to a static HTML collection for GitHub Pages deployment due to complex usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

**Directory Structure (Effective working structure during the trajectory):**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Serves as the main landing page for the Sjòne Shrine organization.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively refactored multiple times. The current version incorporates detailed sections for Hero (tagline: Supporting Future Leaders...), About (Who We Serve for 18-25 year olds), Our Mission (clinical, cyber, self-hood disciplines), Program (4-applicant, 4-year cycle, Were Here For You" support points), Community Support ("Youre Still Welcome, ongoing resources, disclaimer), and a Conclusion. The navigation logo was updated to the user-specified leaf spiral SVG.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The interactive application form.
    -   **Changes Made**: Transformed into a multi-character storyboard experience. It includes fields for personal details, 27 questions (e.g., religion, social media, musical instrument interest, education), and JavaScript functions (, , ) to manage conditional visibility and progressive dialogue reveals.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The donations tracking page, initially a React app, recreated as static HTML due to deployment issues.
    -   **Changes Made**: Repeatedly rebuilt to address regressions. It now displays a 00,000 goal with a current amount of ,750, progress bars for four developmental phases (5K, 0K, 5K, 00K), recent donation cards, and an admin panel for manual donation entry (). The navigation logo was finalized to be the distinct leaf spiral (matching the homepage) with white strokes for visibility, while the main hero logo remained the original diamond pattern. JavaScript handles animations, calculations, and  persistence.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main React application file, identified as the cause of the donations tracker regression.
    -   **Changes Made**: The navigation logo within this React component was updated to the leaf spiral design. The AI was in the process of investigating other files/components within this React app to address the hardcoded donation data (00 goal) that was overriding the static HTML version.

<pending_tasks>
- Upload , , and  to the new GitHub repository ().
- Configure GitHub Pages for the new repository to deploy from the  branch at the root.
- Re-configure the custom domain () to point to the new repository.
- Verify that all three components (homepage, application form, donations tracker) are live and fully functional on the custom domain.
- Identify and update the hardcoded donation data (00 goal) within the React application ( or related components) to ensure the correct 00,000 goal and ,750 current amount are displayed.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting a persistent issue where the donations tracker () was reverting to an old version (showing a 00 goal instead of 00K, and 00 current instead of ,750) despite multiple attempts to update and rebuild the static HTML file.

The root cause was identified by the : an underlying React application in the  directory was still active and its routing system was intercepting the  route, effectively serving its own outdated version of the donations tracker instead of the meticulously updated static HTML file.

The current work involves a pivot from purely static HTML manipulation to addressing the React codebase directly. The AI successfully updated the navigation logo within the React application's  file to the new leaf spiral design. The very last action was attempting to locate and modify the component responsible for displaying the donation data (specifically looking for ), but this file was not found, leaving the task incomplete at the point of the trajectory's end. The overall objective is to ensure the React app, if it continues to be served, displays the correct donation figures and features.
